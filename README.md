## 🌟 About The Project

**3D RideShare** reinvents ride-hailing with a stunning, real-time 3D interactive map. Forget flat, boring interfaces! Visually pinpoint your pick-up and drop-off, see routes come alive, and track vehicles moving in a dynamic 3D urban landscape. It's more than just a ride; it's an immersive journey.

### ✨ Core Features

* **Interactive 3D Map:** Explore a high-fidelity 3D city to precisely select locations.
* **Real-time Tracking:** Watch vehicles and your ride move live in the 3D environment.
* **Dynamic Route Visualization:** Preview your optimized journey in 3D before you confirm.
* **[Add one more key, concise feature, e.g., "Intuitive User & Driver Interfaces"]**

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built for performance and scalability, 3D RideShare leverages cutting-edge technologies:

* **3D Engine:** **[React.js, Three.js , Unity WebGL]** – For immersive 3D rendering and interactive scenes.
* **Real-time Communication:** **[WebSockets (Node.js/Socket.IO)]** – Powers live location updates and instant communication.
* **Backend & Data:** **[AWS Amplify / Node.js (Express) / FastAPI)]** – Handles user data, ride logistics, and server-side logic.
* **Mapping & Location:** **[Google Maps Platform (Maps SDK for Unity/JS, Photorealistic 3D Tiles) / Mapbox]** – Provides accurate geographical data and stunning 3D city models.
* **Database:** **[PostgreSQL]** – For robust data storage.
* **Authentication:** **[OAuth 2.0]** – Secure user management.
* **[Optional: Add one more crucial tech, e.g., "Payment Gateway: Stripe"]**
